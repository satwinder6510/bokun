Please do ALL of the following:

1. Identify all clickable elements

Search for:

<button>

<a>

<Link> (React Router)

<div onClick>

<div role="button">

Any component with props:
onClick, onPress, onSelect, onTap

List them with the file and component name.

2. For every clickable element, check:

Is its visible area at least 44px × 44px (Apple HIG) or 48px × 48px (Google Material/SEO)?

Does it have at least 8px padding on all sides?

Is text clickable or only the icon/small area?

On mobile, can a finger easily tap it without zoom?

Identify failures and list them with paths.

3. Check for click blockers

Search for:

overlay divs covering elements (e.g., modal fade, header blur)

elements with:
position: absolute; pointer-events: none/auto;

invisible elements higher in DOM tree blocking interaction

z-index conflicts

Tell me:

Which elements are blocked?

Why?

What should be changed?

4. Check all cards

Many rage clicks come from users clicking a card expecting it to be clickable.

Audit all card components (in client/src/components/**/) and confirm:

If a card REPRESENTS a clickable item (package, cruise, tour…), the entire card should be clickable, not just the small "view details" button.

Ensure the card has:

cursor: pointer

role="link"

Accessible click area ≥ 48×48 on mobile

List which cards need to be made fully clickable.

5. Generate fixes (code MODIFICATIONS)

For each issue FOUND:

Provide exact code changes

Patch suggestions (before + after)

Only adjustments needed (padding, min-height, making card clickable, adding cursor: pointer, etc.)

DO NOT break existing styles or layouts.

6. Output format

Respond in this structure:

[ISSUE CATEGORY]
- File:
- Component:
- Problem:
- Fix:
- Code patch:

[REPEAT FOR ALL ISSUES]

Notes

Do NOT make changes blindly — inspect each clickable element in context.

Ensure no layout shifts or design regressions.

Respect existing Tailwind or CSS modules.

Must pass Lighthouse "Tap targets" accessibility check.
