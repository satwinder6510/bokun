REPLIT PROMPT: Rank “India holidays” in the UK (destination hub + internal links + UK intent signals)

Implement a UK-focused SEO upgrade for the India destination page at:

/destinations/india

Do not change React UI. Use the existing server-side SEO injection system (head + #seo-content + <noscript>). Content must be generated only from our own package inventory and our own policies (no external destination facts or scraped guide text).

1) Make /destinations/india a UK-intent destination hub (guide-grade)
Data source

Use the packages that belong to India by our current destination rule:

destination slug “india” maps to package.category === "India" (case-insensitive, slug-normalized).

Compute aggregates (India packages only)

packageCount

priceMin, priceMedian, priceMax (GBP only for now)

topTags (top 8 from tags[])

durationBuckets from duration nights (1–4, 5–7, 8–10, 11–14, 15+)

topInclusions from whatsIncluded[] (normalize strings, count frequency, select top 10)

featuredPackages top 12 (by updatedAt desc or displayOrder)

Inject additional “India Guide” content into #seo-content BEFORE the package list

Add these sections with semantic HTML:

H1: India Holidays & Packages from the UK

Inventory-based overview paragraph (900–1,500 chars total across intro + sections)
Must explicitly include UK-intent phrases:

“India holidays from the UK”

“India holiday packages”

“India tours”
Use only inventory-derived statements. Example style:

“Explore {packageCount} India holiday packages from the UK…”

“Typical trip lengths include {topDurationBuckets}…”

“Popular styles include {topTags}…”

“Prices start from £{priceMin}…”

Popular trip styles (bullets from topTags)

Typical trip lengths (bucket counts)

What’s commonly included (topInclusions; use frequency-aware wording: “many/some”)

Featured India holidays (list top 12 packages with absolute URLs + From £price)

FAQs (India): add 10–14 FAQs using <details> blocks
Questions must target UK search intent and conversion:

“What’s included in India holiday packages from the UK?”

“Do your India holidays include flights?”

“How long are your India tours typically?”

“What is the starting price for India holidays?”

“Can I customise an India holiday package?”

“Do I need travel insurance?”

“Are local taxes included?”

“How do I book and get confirmation?”
Include contact line in at least one FAQ answer:

“Email holidayenq@flightsandpackages.com
”

Keep the existing package link list and breadcrumb nav.

2) Upgrade head meta for India (UK-intent)

If no manual meta exists, set fallbacks:

Title:
India Holidays & India Holiday Packages from the UK | Flights and Packages

Meta description (inventory-based + UK intent):
Browse {packageCount} India holiday packages from the UK. Popular trip styles: {topTags[0..2]}. Typical stays: {topDurationBucket}. From £{priceMin}. Enquire at holidayenq@flightsandpackages.com.

Canonical must remain:
https://holidays.flightsandpackages.com/destinations/india

3) Add/upgrade JSON-LD on /destinations/india

Keep existing TouristDestination + BreadcrumbList, but enhance and add:

TouristDestination.description should be the inventory-based UK-intent summary (not generic).

Add ItemList JSON-LD for featuredPackages:

name

url (absolute)

Offer with GBP price if available

Add FAQPage JSON-LD matching the injected FAQs.

Ensure each of these appears only once:

TouristDestination (1)

BreadcrumbList (1)

ItemList (1)

FAQPage (1)

4) Add internal links to strengthen India hub authority
On every India package page (/Holidays/india/:slug)

In the injected SEO content, add a short “hub link” section:

“See all India holidays and packages” linking to /destinations/india

From homepage + collections

Add a prominent internal link in injected SEO fragments (or nav if safe) to:

/destinations/india

5) Optional supporting page (high ROI, UK modifier)

Create a lightweight supporting page:

/destinations/india/holiday-deals
This can reuse the same India aggregate, but focus on:

lowest starting prices

featured packages

UK-intent FAQ
Canonical to itself.

Add it to sitemap.

Acceptance tests

curl -s <india-url> | grep -c "<!DOCTYPE html>" → 1

curl -s <india-url> | grep -c '"@type":"FAQPage"\|"@type": "FAQPage"' → 1

curl -s <india-url> | grep -c '"@type":"ItemList"\|"@type": "ItemList"' → 1

curl -s <india-url> | grep -i "India holidays from the UK" | wc -l → >= 1

India package pages contain an internal link to /destinations/india

Do not introduce any external factual destination content or scraped text.

If Replit asks where to put it: tell it to implement inside your existing server/seo pipeline (where destinations are injected today), and to add an India-only “UK intent layer” that overrides the generic destination template.
