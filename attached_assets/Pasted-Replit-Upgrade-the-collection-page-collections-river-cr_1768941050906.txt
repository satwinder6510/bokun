Replit: Upgrade the collection page /collections/river-cruises to rank for “river cruises” (UK) by adding guide-grade SEO injection (no UI changes).

Requirements:

Identify the collection route handler for /collections/:slug and apply special handling when slug === "river-cruises".

Fetch the same published packages shown on that collection page.

Build aggregates from those packages:

packageCount

priceMin/median/max (GBP only)

topTags from tags[]

durationBuckets from duration nights (1–4, 5–7, 8–10, 11–14, 15+)

topInclusions from whatsIncluded[] (normalize + frequency)

topDestinations from category counts (top 8)

featuredPackages top 12 by updatedAt desc (or displayOrder)

Inject into #seo-content (and optional shortened <noscript>) BEFORE the list:

H1: River Cruises

Intro paragraph (800–1500 chars total across sections) using only our inventory and policies; include phrases:

“river cruises”

“river cruise packages”

“from the UK” (at least once)

Sections:

Popular river cruise styles (topTags)

Typical trip lengths (durationBuckets with counts)

What’s commonly included (topInclusions; frequency-aware “many/some”)

Top destinations in our river cruises (topDestinations list with links to /destinations/:slug where available)

Featured river cruises (12 internal links + From £price)

FAQs (10–14) as <details> blocks, including booking/contact via holidayenq@flightsandpackages.com

Add head meta fallbacks (manual-first if present):

Title fallback: River Cruises | River Cruise Packages from the UK | Flights and Packages

Description fallback: inventory-based summary (packageCount + from price + typical durations)

Canonical: /collections/river-cruises

Add JSON-LD in head:

BreadcrumbList: Home → Collections → River Cruises

CollectionPage (or WebPage) with name/url/description derived from inventory (no external facts)

ItemList for featuredPackages (with Offer GBP price if available)

FAQPage matching FAQs
Ensure each appears only once.

Acceptance tests:

curl -s <url> | grep -c "<!DOCTYPE html>" = 1

FAQPage JSON-LD count = 1

ItemList JSON-LD count = 1

Page contains the phrase “river cruise packages” at least once in injected text

#seo-content includes >= 12 internal package links when available
