Implement this change in my existing Replit monorepo (holidays.flightsandpackages.com). We already have server-side SEO injection working that outputs: H1, overview/description, destination, duration, price. We need to improve AI-friendliness by also server-rendering key “answerable” sections that are currently client-only.

HARD RULES
- Do NOT touch checkout, payments, admin, auth, Stripe flows.
- Do NOT migrate frameworks.
- Keep SPA hydration exactly as-is.
- All new behavior behind existing SEO flags; if anything fails, fall back to current HTML injection output.
- Do not add heavy runtime network calls; use the same DB/Bokun cached data source already used for tour pages. Cache server-rendered fragments.

GOAL
For tour pages (and destination pages if data exists), extend the server HTML response so it includes, BEFORE hydration:
1) “What’s included” (top 5–7 bullets)
2) “What’s not included” (top 5–7 bullets)
3) FAQs (top 3–5 Q&As)
4) “Who this tour is best for” + “Not suitable for” (top 3–6 bullets each)
5) Optional: 2–3 related tours links (same destination), plain <a> tags only

STRICT CONTENT RULES
- Output plain semantic HTML (h2/h3, p, ul/li, a). No accordions/carousels/tabs.
- Use the EXACT same source fields as the client uses so content matches (no paraphrasing).
- Keep it short to avoid bloat: cap bullets and FAQs as above.
- Only include sections if data exists. If missing, omit the section entirely.
- Ensure all JSON-LD matches visible content (no hidden schema).

WHERE TO CHANGE
- Locate the current server SEO injection code (e.g., server/seo/inject.ts or equivalent).
- There should be a function building the server-rendered “body content” or injecting HTML into index.html.
- Add a new fragment builder, e.g. server/seo/fragments.ts:
  - buildInclusionsHtml(tour)
  - buildFaqHtml(tour)
  - buildSuitabilityHtml(tour)
  - buildRelatedToursHtml(tour, relatedTours)
- Add safe escaping for text fields to prevent broken HTML.
- Add caching for the fragment output per tour slug (TTL ~5–15 min), reuse your existing cache utility.

JSON-LD UPDATES
- If FAQs are rendered, add/update FAQPage JSON-LD on tour pages using those same questions/answers.
- Keep existing Product/TouristTrip schema; do not invent fields.
- Do not add AggregateRating unless it is displayed on the page.

ROUTING
- Apply only to tour detail pages (whatever your real prefix is: /Holidays/:country/:slug or /tours/:slug).
- Do NOT apply to checkout/account/admin routes.
- Keep destination pages unchanged unless you already have “FAQs/Includes” equivalents; if you do, add only FAQs + related links.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (MUST SHOW RESULTS)
Pick 1 real tour URL and confirm:
1) View Source contains:
   - H1
   - Overview paragraph
   - “What’s included” UL (if data exists)
   - “What’s not included” UL (if data exists)
   - FAQ section with 3–5 Q&As (if data exists)
   - Best for / Not suitable lists (if data exists)
2) View Source contains JSON-LD with FAQPage that matches the visible FAQs.
3) If data is missing, sections are omitted (no empty headings).
4) SPA still hydrates and booking flow still works unchanged.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide list of changed files and brief description.
- Provide the example tour URL used for acceptance tests and paste the relevant View Source snippets showing the new sections.
Proceed now.
