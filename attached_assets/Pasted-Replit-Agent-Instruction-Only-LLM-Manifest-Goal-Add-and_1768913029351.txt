Replit Agent Instruction (Only LLM Manifest)

Goal: Add and serve a machine-readable llm-manifest.json for AI crawlers on holidays.flightsandpackages.com. Do not modify any SEO injection logic (already fixed), do not modify client code, and do not change existing routes except adding one new SEO endpoint.

Tasks

Serve it via Express (SEO routes only)

In server/seo/routes.ts inside registerSeoRoutes(app), add a new route:

GET /llm-manifest.json should:

return the JSON file

set header Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

set Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600

Implementation approach (preferred):

read the file from disk using process.cwd() so it works on Replit

do not add any new dependencies

Acceptance checks

GET /llm-manifest.json returns 200

Response is valid JSON

Does not affect any existing SEO routes, SPA routes, or build

Do not do anything else.
